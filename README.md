BookHub is a website for UofT students to buy, sell or trade used textbooks for different courses. A seller will need to input book’s title, author, course code, price, short description, etc. and may choose to attach images. A buyer may search by course code or book’s title to find the corresponding textbooks. A buyer can also send email directly to the seller. A buyer can also review/rate the seller’s trustworthiness after purchasing from this seller.
